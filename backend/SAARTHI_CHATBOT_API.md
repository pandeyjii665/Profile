## Frontend Integration Guide

### Step 1: Initialize Chat State

```javascript
const [chatState, setChatState] = useState({
  currentStage: 1,
  currentQuestionIndex: 0,
  questions: [],
  answers: {},
  pendingWhyQuestion: null,
  complete: false
});
```

### Step 2: Generate Questions

```javascript
const generateQuestions = async (userProfile) => {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('http://localhost:8080/api/generate-questions', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({ userProfile }),
    });
    
    const data = await response.json();
    if (data.data && data.data.questions) {
      setChatState(prev => ({
        ...prev,
        questions: data.data.questions,
        currentQuestionIndex: 0,
        currentStage: 1
      }));
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error generating questions:', error);
  }
};
```

### Step 3: Process Chat Messages

```javascript
const sendMessage = async (userMessage) => {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('http://localhost:8080/api/chat', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        userMessage,
        conversationState: chatState
      }),
    });
    
    const data = await response.json();
    if (data.data) {
      setChatState(data.data.conversationState);
      
      if (data.data.isComplete) {
        // All questions answered, proceed to evaluation
        proceedToEvaluation();
      } else {
        // Display next question
        displayQuestion(data.data.nextQuestion);
      }
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error processing chat:', error);
  }
};
```

### Step 4: Evaluate Results

```javascript
const evaluateInterests = async (userProfile, answers) => {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('http://localhost:8080/api/evaluate', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        userProfile,
        answers
      }),
    });
    
    const data = await response.json();
    if (data.data) {
      // Display evaluation results
      displayEvaluationResults(data.data);
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error evaluating interests:', error);
  }
};
```

## Database Storage (Generic Implementation)

### Option 1: Store Chat State in MongoDB

Create a `ChatSession` entity:

```java
@Document(collection = "chat_sessions")
public class ChatSession {
    @Id
    private String id;
    private String userId;
    private ChatState chatState;
    private LocalDateTime createdAt;
    private LocalDateTime updatedAt;
    // getters and setters
}
```

### Option 2: Store in Frontend (LocalStorage/SessionStorage)

```javascript
// Save chat state
localStorage.setItem('saarthi_chat_state', JSON.stringify(chatState));

// Load chat state
const savedState = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('saarthi_chat_state'));
```

### Option 3: Store Evaluation Results

```java
@Document(collection = "evaluations")
public class Evaluation {
    @Id
    private String id;
    private String userId;
    private EvaluationResult result;
    private LocalDateTime evaluatedAt;
    // getters and setters
}
```

---

## Error Handling

All endpoints return standard error responses:

```json
{
  "message": "Error description",
  "data": null
}
```

**HTTP Status Codes:**
- `200 OK`: Success
- `400 Bad Request`: Invalid input
- `500 Internal Server Error`: Server error

---

## Notes

1. **Chatbot Name**: The chatbot is named "Saarthi" (meaning "guide" or "companion" in Hindi).

2. **Question Stages**:
   - Stage 1 (Questions 1-4): Technical skills and problem-solving
   - Stage 2 (Questions 5-8): Creativity and design thinking
   - Stage 3 (Questions 9-12): Leadership, management, entrepreneurship, research

3. **WHY Questions**: The chatbot may ask follow-up "WHY" questions for substantial answers (50+ characters) to dig deeper into user reasoning.

4. **Score Normalization**: Interest scores are automatically normalized to sum to 100%.

5. **JSON Mode**: The evaluation endpoint uses OpenAI's JSON mode to ensure valid JSON responses.

## Environment Variables

Ensure the following environment variable is set:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

Or in `application.properties`:

```properties
openai.api.key=your_openai_api_key_here
```
